This is a simple editor for creating and editing indoor maps.\
The data can be used in my [indoor3D](https://github.com/wolfwind521/indoor3D) project for visualization.

Now it can only export a json file by my own definition, but it will support the GeoJson format in the future.
More instructions are coming on the way.
